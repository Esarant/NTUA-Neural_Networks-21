# NTUA-Neural_Networks-21

In this repo we host the notebooks from the ["Neural Networks and Intelligent Systems"](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3319) course of NTUA.

During the semester we worked in teams of 3 and we had to prepare 3 labs. The first was on supervised learning, the second on unsupervised learning and the third on deep learning. 



## The Labs

### Lab 1 - Supervised Learning

On the first lab we studied and optimized classifiers on two specific datasets. The first was the [Magic GAMMA Telescope](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MAGIC+Gamma+Telescope) from the UCI ML repository and the second was the [CS:GO Round winnder classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christianlillelund/csgo-round-winner-classification). On the first dataset we used skicit-learn functions while on the second we had to create our own functions using existing libraries.

### Lab 2 - Unsupervised Learning

On the second lab, we worked on a 5.000 movies subset of the [Carnegie Mellon Movie Summary Corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Neural Network and tf-idf numerical statistic in order to develop a movie recommender system.

### Lab 3 - Deep Learning

On the third and fina lab, we expanded upon the [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/image_captioning) for Image Captioning with visual attention. We worked on a different dataset than that of the tutorial and the goal was to optimize the captions for the images of the dataset
